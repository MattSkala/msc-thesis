When I was choosing my thesis topic, I originally came up with an idea of designing a decentralized social network. After realizing how ambitious that goal was, I later decided to focus on more fundamental issues first and create a library that would allow for building any decentralized applications, running purely on an overlay network consisting of smartphones. Rather than reinventing the wheel, I took inspiration from an existing networking library developed at TU Delft over the last decade and created its wire-compatible implementation in Kotlin. Interestingly, in the end, I have even implemented a trivial social network to demonstrate the usage of the library, returning back to the original idea.

I would like to thank my supervisor Johan Pouwelse for an endless stream of fresh ideas and valuable feedback, and to PhD students of the Delft Blockchain Lab for numerous coffee meetings and for serving me as a walking documentation of the existing codebase.
